ROTARY ENCODER LIBRARY ATMEGA328P
=================================

Descripton:
    It is simple and customizable library for rotary encoder.
that library purpose is detect direction of encoder rotation
and increase or decrease encoder rotation count. it requiers 
PCINT ISR for work correctly.
    WARNING:if you don't use PCINT it doesn't reads fast rotations, 
also WITHOUT PCINT it doesn't works at all if you have big code.
